# The Wave Function Collapse Algorithm in React

The algorithm in this project is a simple version of this one
https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse

I work in this repo with set rules without any input
whereas the algorithm in named repo takes an example input
and creates a result based on it

## But what is Wave function collapse you ask?

Stuff you can check out and learn more about it

2 Wonderful videos explaining what this algorithm is
